	    <section>Knight was born on the 24th of November, 1958, in Hammersmith, London, England. His Father was a psychologist, his mother was a physiotherapist, and his brother was a chemist. Initially Knight was interested going to pursue a Biology degree, but he didn't find the subject interesting. Instead, he studied photography, which he had liked since he was a teen. He studied at the Bournemouth & Poole College of Art and Design. His first photography book, "Skinhead," was published by i-D magazines in 1982, and in 1996 it won the Designers and Art Directors Award for Best Book Cover. In 1993, Knight took a break from the fashion world and worked with David Chipperfield, an architect, to make "Power Plant," a gallery at the Natural History Museum located in London, which "explores the relationship between people and plants." Later that same year he returned to fashion photography. He has since worked with many designers and companies to create many different images and films. In 2000, he started SHOWstudio, a website dedicated to fashion film. He lives with his wife, Charlotte Knight and their three children in Petersham, a suburb outside of London, in 2 houses that David Chipperfield designed for him. In 2016, Knight shot the portraits of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles for the Queen's 90th birthday.

        <section>According to SHOWstudio's youtube video, "Thoughts on Fashion Film," Nick Knight believes the internet is the best medium in which to portray fashion, as it is widely acessible and can show movement, which can better show what the designer intended when creating the piece. Knight says that this is why he created SHOWstudio; to give a platform to fashion film. When creating an image or a film for fashion, Knight says that he doesn't have to create a narrative for it because it is already there, and that great fashion already takes into account aspects like color, juxtaposition, shapes, and historical reference.
