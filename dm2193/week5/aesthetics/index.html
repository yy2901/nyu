	    <section>Throughout his more than 4 decade career, Nick Knight has consistently challenged the world of art along with its unspoken rules of aesthetics and beauty standards with his captivating and alluring work. His talent and slight provocateur has resulted in him being one of the most revolutionary and influential photographers in the present day. No doubt a visionary, his ingenuity and talent has garnered him partnerships with some of the most prolific designers in fashion, including Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Gareth Pugh and Alexander McQueen.</section>
        <div id="aesthetics" style="animation: animatedbackground infinite 20s;height: 300px;background-size:contain ;"></div>
        <section>From his personal to client-based collaborations, Knight consistently breaks beauty barriers and is relentless with his vibrant use of color and texture. A common theme throughout his work is making use of flowers and air but dissecting these natural elements into a more surreal and unorthodox presentation, often as ornamentation to the model on display but equally (if not more)  important to the overall shot.</section>

        </div>
        <section>To me, it seems that Knight has created a world of his own, an augmented reality, if you will, teeming with unconventional characters and whims that are simultaneously nightmarish but alluring and more often than not accompanied by a more pallid and pastel color scheme. </section>
